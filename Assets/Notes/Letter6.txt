Hi Dad,

I saw your ship launch today! It was the coolest thing ever. I told all my friends that my dad is an astronaut AND a scientist. They think you're the best (but not as much as I do).

Mom says I have to do my homework now, but I wanted to say I love you and I can't wait until you come home.

Love,

Max

P.S. Can you bring me a moon rock?
