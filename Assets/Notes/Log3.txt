Responded to a report of strange noises near Lab 3. Found nothing unusual, but did notice a flicker in the power grid. Might be time to service the generators. Also, someone left a half-eaten sandwich in the console. Seriously, people?

Power fluctuations are becoming more frequent. I've scheduled a full diagnostic. On an unrelated note, I thought I saw something moving in the vents. Probably just sleep deprivation playing tricks on me.
