Hey Tim,

Remember that time we joked about finding space jellyfish on Ganymede? Well, make sure you don't bring any souvenirs back that glow in the dark! Just kidding.

All jokes aside, the office isn't the same without your terrible coffee and worse puns. Come back soon, or at least send some new jokes to keep us entertained.

Take care out there, space cowboy.

Cheers,

Alex
