Dr. Hayes asked me to monitor the biomass cultures overnight. The cells exhibit bioluminescence under certain wavelengths. It's mesmerizing, like watching a tiny galaxy in a petri dish.

I could swear the biomass reacts to my presence. When I approached the containment unit, the luminescence intensified. Probably just a coincidence, but I'll log it anyway.
