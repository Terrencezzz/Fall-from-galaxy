Tomorrow we land on Ganymede, after 2 years of spaceflight. I can't wait to finally stretch my legs and get off this damn ship. I do love this ship, but the fact only a thin strip of aluminium composite keeps me and the vaccuum seperated is slightly unnerving.

It's colder than expected under the ice of this planet. We finally set up a few underground labs after the drilling team got set up on day one. Apart from the cold, the new environment systems are running smoothly, and it feels good to be back under some real gravity for once. The drilling crew are still digging for the sample of biomass we detected 2 years back from earth, hopefully they will let us researchers get our hands on it soon!

I've never seen anything like this. This peice of boimass hidden under the ice has properties I have never even imagined. Once it began to warm up, small samples began to display the tendancy to completely rewrite its' genetic code in a matter of days to better adapt to its'
environment. Whatever planet this organism came from, it must have been incredibly widespread.

I'm not sure if Aerin and Frank are still alive, or if the people outside the lab are even Aerin and Frank anymore. I can't beleive how quickly everything collapsed. On the bright side, I think I've almost found a workable anti-body.

I can't take it anymore. They are everywhere. Garry, if you ever read this, I am so sorry. I don't think i'll make it back to Earth. I love you and the kids more than anything.
