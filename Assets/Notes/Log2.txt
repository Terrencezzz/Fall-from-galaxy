Routine patrols have been uneventful. The science team is excited about their "goo," as I like to call it. Personally, as long as it doesn't sprout legs and chase me down the corridor, I'm happy.

Heard some strange noises near the lab today. Probably just the ventilation acting up again. I'll have engineering take a look. Can't have the scientists getting spooked over nothing.
