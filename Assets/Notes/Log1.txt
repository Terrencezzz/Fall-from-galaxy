Sample 887-3387: Sewing patterns for a soft toy elephant, drawn to have a trunk that splits into three halfway along its length. Elephant has no tusks and prominent udders.

Sample 887-3391: One page, apparently from a script for a Bobble the Clown TV show. Bobble is demonstrating how to 'catch some more' cyclists by stringing wires across cycle trails. Handwriting is extremely florid and includes a border of loops and smiley faces around the page. Show not intercepted by the Foundation, though tone is a good match for known episodes.
