We've finally received the biomass samples from under the ice. Preliminary analysis shows an unusual resilience to extreme conditions. The cells remain viable even after exposure to vacuum and radiation. I have a feeling we're on the cusp of something extraordinary.

Culturing the biomass has proven more difficult than anticipated. It seems to require a unique combination of amino acids not found in standard media. Dr. Pearch suggests we try synthesizing a custom growth medium. Her enthusiasm is contagious.

Success! The biomass is growing, and rapidly at that. Under the microscope, the cellular structures are unlike anything documented. They seem to adapt their morphology in response to stimuli. This could redefine our understanding of life itself.
