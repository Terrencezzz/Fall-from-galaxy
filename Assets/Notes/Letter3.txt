Dear Mom,

I finally made it onto the Marie Celeste! Can you believe it? Me, on a real deep-space mission! I promise to bring you back something specialâ€”maybe a rock or some alien goo (if it's allowed).

Don't worry about me; the crew is great, and the food isn't as bad as you warned. I'll write more once we reach Ganymede.

Love you to the moon and back (literally!),

Sam
