Dear Dr. Nguyen,

Congratulations on being selected for the Ganymede mission! Your expertise in genetic engineering is second to none. The entire faculty is proud of you.

Remember to keep an eye out for any interesting floraâ€”or fauna! And don't forget to send us a postcard (or at least a data packet) when you make your groundbreaking discoveries.

Warm regards,

Professor Helen Moore

Dean of Biological Sciences
