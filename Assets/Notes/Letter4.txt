Dear Jake,

I bet you're still mad that I beat you at chess before I left. Here's a little secret: I may have swapped the pieces when you weren't looking. Consider it payback for eating my sandwich last week.

Don't tell anyone, or I'll deny everything.

Miss you, buddy.

Your favorite (and only) sister,

Lily
