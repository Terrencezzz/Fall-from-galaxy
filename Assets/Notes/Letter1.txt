Dear Dr. Martinez,

I hope this message reaches you before you depart for Ganymede. I wanted to express my utmost admiration for your work in xenobiology. The way you inspire young scientists like myself is unparalleled. I heard about your upcoming mission, and I know you'll make groundbreaking discoveries.

Please accept this small tokenâ€”a lucky charm I've carried since my first day in the lab. May it bring you good fortune on your journey.

Best regards,

Amelia Clarke
