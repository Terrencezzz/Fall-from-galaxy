Responded to an incident in Lab 2. Dr. Lee claimed she saw the biomass move on its own. When we arrived, the sample was... gone. Labs are supposed to be secure. Initiated a full lockdown until we find the missing material.

Still no sign of the missing biomass. Some of the crew are getting jittery. I ordered additional patrols. Can't shake the feeling that something's off.
