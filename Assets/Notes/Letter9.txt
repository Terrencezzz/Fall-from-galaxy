Chrissie,

How are things on the ship? Hope all is well, I get a little worried when I don't hear from you for more than a month. Get back to me ASAP! I miss you a lot. 

A quick update on things at home; the girls are fine, a little restless while school is out but nothing new. David got a new dog, and he's been letting the girls take it for walks when he goes for his operations. The microwave keeps breaking, so I'll have to get another one. Otherwise, nothing much happening at this end of the solar system. 

All the best my love,
Jeremy.
